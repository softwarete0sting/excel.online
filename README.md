## How to Share a File in Excel Online?

_Just like Excel for Microsoft 365 and Excel 2019, the web-based version of Excel uses the co-authoring features in place of what used to be known as Shared Workbooks._

* Go to Excel Online in a web browser and open the workbook you want to share.
* Select Share, located in the upper-right corner of the browser window to display the Invite People dialog box.
* In the To field, type the email addresses of the people you want to share the workbook with, each separated by a comma.
* In the Add a quick note field, enter a relevant message for your recipients.
* Select Recipients can edit.
* Two drop-down menus appear. The first contains the following options: Recipients can edit (default) and Recipients can only view. If you choose the latter, your recipients receive the workbook with read-only restrictions.
* The second drop-down menu dictates whether your recipients require a Microsoft account to access the document. Select the option that meets your needs.
* Select Share. Your recipients are notified that a workbook has been shared with them.

## Is Excel online the same as Excel?

The majority of Excel desktop features and functions are displayed and supported similarly in Excel Online, and for most data spreadsheet projects, you won't notice a difference between Online or desktop. Excel Online is designed identically, and offers similar functions for gathering, analyzing, and visualizing data.
